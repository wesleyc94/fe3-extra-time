# Extra time
In this log i'll describe the extra hours i've spent during this course. I've made an log with all kinds of extra materials i've used during this course to make up the 20 hours outside the assignments and assessments. On this page i'll keep a track of all the resources i've used and whether it fits with the course goals.

## Resources
When i started this course I've had a hard time catching up with writing javascript again. I haven't wrote any code in a while and I haven't done a front-end internship but a visual design internship instead. Due to this I had to catch up with my javascript in the beginning of the course. The bootcamp in class one helped me alot, but also extra time.

In these videos there is an introduction to D3, what D3 is and why it is used. D3 stands for Data Driven Documents. It is a Javascript library that allows you to visualise data into a graph on a web page. These set of tutorials were found on youtube and helped me starting off with D3.

While I was working with the assignment and the assessments I had to work with data and get the values from a certain place. In the classes there were methods given but not really explained, to get more information about this I did some research about it and tried to learn more about Arrays and Objects.

While working with D3 in the beginning of the course I didnt really understand anything of the code, or what I was doing at all. To get more information about how things are working in the code and making the bar chart assignment, i've looked up through some tutorials how things were done and why. These sites were used to get to learn D3 and how to make a bar chart, so it fits with course goals.

Next to videos and reading I had was also stuck with certain questions inside the code, i've firstly tried looking on stackoverflow if the there was someone with same question with a replied anwser. Or used google about a subject and came up with a question on stackoverflow that was interesting to me aswell.

While I was working with Assessment 3 i was struggling with how to get the data/values from a selected bar element into a new chart and provide the new bars with new data. I was searching around if there were solutions to this problem and by doing this it really helped me think out how to get to the solution. I already had some feeling i had to work with arrays and objects and went on searching around these subjects.

After this course i've learned alot about D3 and how to get along with it. The classes, assignments, assessments, extra time certainly provided me a good basic knowledge about D3 and will help me towards project Information Design.
